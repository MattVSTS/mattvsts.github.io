<p>As we’ve seen, once Operations send to Engineering issues, they are just Team Foundation Server’s Work Items.</p> <p>This specific Work Item Type is tailored on the need of explaining a production incident, probably a bug, so it features several useful information out-of-the-box. It’s tied to the AVICode informations, and the most important thing here is the state:</p> <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-46BceZIquxE/UUnEli4l5YI/AAAAAAAAA0g/N9XnIijjQZY/s1600-h/image%25255B2%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-CwM2CAN4F8A/UUnEmZfT6JI/AAAAAAAAA0o/2darN44MvWw/image_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="244" height="151"></a></p> <p>After we acknowledge we are on the Issue itself, we have a broad range of states to be set: this is essential for organizations with a structured process (think about ITIL).</p> <p>Apart from that, it’s a standard WIT, so there is not so much to say on the Engineering side. Hey, we are who were already working with Team Foundation Server! <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-BRlBr1h6qqQ/UUnEnTSdZMI/AAAAAAAAA0w/6K5gptUHafE/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800"></p> <p>There is an IntelliTrace file too, as mentioned. In the next post we are going to see how to better capture all the information we need.</p>
