<p>Team Foundation Server is around since 2005, and many features seem to be forgotten despite being in the same place as usual.</p> <p>If I asked for a dollar/euro/pound every time I was asked this I would be a billionaire as of now:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Can I have a Development Task, Testing Task, Documentation Task Work Item Type in TFS?</em></p></blockquote> <p>You can definitely have such a WIT, but would this make any sense? Excluding any consideration about your methodology (this unfortunately is a question I keep getting regardless of Scrum/Agile/Waterfall/CMMI/etc.), why would you have a different WIT for different <em>flavours</em> of the same?</p> <p>Usually reasons here vary, but one of the most consistent is this:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>I would like to visually understand how the requirement is split and this also makes life easier for team members with different roles in the team.</em></p></blockquote> <p>I mean – the first part is fair enough. But as for the second… it is all about the human rejection of changes <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zf9gbJRlO-8/V-ziqqG5M2I/AAAAAAAAD3E/j01OH0Juzng/wlEmoticon-smile2.png?imgmax=800">&nbsp;</p> <p>So, in my opinion the best way of tackling this request (I can’t even class it as a <em>problem</em>…) is to use the Activity field which every Work Item has. Simple as that.</p> <p>Let’s take this for example:</p> <p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UBIV31FLRB4/V-zir0OYOdI/AAAAAAAAD3M/kQ3oOJmYts8/s1600-h/clip_image002%25255B3%25255D.jpg"><img title="clip_image002" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="clip_image002" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-69JcDGRQHYs/V-zitK9V_9I/AAAAAAAAD3U/KM7v1yuoe_o/clip_image002_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" width="244" height="78"></a></p> <p>This comes from the backlog, and all the children tasks are…tasks <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zf9gbJRlO-8/V-ziqqG5M2I/AAAAAAAAD3E/j01OH0Juzng/wlEmoticon-smile2.png?imgmax=800">but leveraging the Activity field you can categorise these children tasks:</p> <p><b><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Y7AL_SxHjrI/V-ziu1KLUTI/AAAAAAAAD3c/isioiNa7nj8/s1600-h/clip_image002%25255B4%25255D%25255B2%25255D.jpg"><img title="clip_image002[4]" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="clip_image002[4]" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7BNrB9WoBPw/V-ziwN-fIrI/AAAAAAAAD3k/xmI6feeEbgA/clip_image002%25255B4%25255D_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" width="212" height="244"></a></b></p> <p>Needless to say the Activity list can be customised. Once you do that, you might want to apply some styling rules to the task board, leading to something like this:</p> <p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Hz-PbNFlqQU/V-zixV1pLyI/AAAAAAAAD3s/CuSbA_dBEtU/s1600-h/clip_image002%25255B6%25255D%25255B3%25255D.jpg"><img title="clip_image002[6]" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="clip_image002[6]" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cUV2vvtdLXY/V-ziykBwAzI/AAAAAAAAD30/gc8iMgfdZSo/clip_image002%25255B6%25255D_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="504" height="198"></a></p> <p>And as a side-effect, if you use the Remaining Work field as well – as many do, regardless of the methodology as well, given that you might need to report on it – you’ll get a nice breakdown by Activity:</p> <p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AUohVRSUKMg/V-ziz4sygoI/AAAAAAAAD38/RaAozCUruMc/s1600-h/image%25255B2%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Zw0_Znc_-2U/V-zi1Fd9uAI/AAAAAAAAD4E/ZUv3X4LEkaM/image_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="200" height="228"></a></p> <p>It is worth mentioning that this field is around since at least <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa337627(v=vs.90).aspx">TFS 2008</a>.</p>
