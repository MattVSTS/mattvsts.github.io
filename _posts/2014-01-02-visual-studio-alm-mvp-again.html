<p>Every year since 2010, the first day of the year is marked by the email from the MVP Award, and this year is no exception: I have been reawarded this year as well, for the 5th year in a row on Visual Studio ALM again :) </p> <p>It is a huge pleasure and I am really honoured by this, and moreover this year with the relocation and all the other changes it has been <em>harder</em>.</p> <p>I definitely need to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/ClaireS_MS">Claire</a>, my CPM, and the whole Visual Studio ALM team for this.</p> <p>I will always do my best for the technical community all around the world, as it is something I really enjoy doing, so letâ€™s see what happens during this 2014!</p>
