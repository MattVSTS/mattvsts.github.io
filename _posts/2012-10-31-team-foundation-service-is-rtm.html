<p>Today at //Build Microsoft unveiled what a lot of people was waiting for: the RTM of Team Foundation Service. <p>You can reach it at <a href="http://tfs.visualstudio.com/">http://tfs.visualstudio.com/</a>, despite the old <a href="http://tfspreview.com">http://tfspreview.com</a> will still work for some time. Billing is still not active, but now we know somewhat more over it <p>Here’s what you were waiting for: as promised, there’s still a free level of service.  <p>It’s going to be free for team up to five users, with no feature limits! <p>And moreover, who has a MSDN Premium, Test Professional or Ultimate is entitled to have an unlimited subscription included inside his MSDN!  <p>There’s going to be a paid service with unlimited users for who has not a MSDN Subscription but it’s still early to talk about that. <p>The only Team Foundation Service component still in beta is the Hosted Team Build.</p>
