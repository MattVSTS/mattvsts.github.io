<p>As you know, in one of the latest Team Foundation Service deployments (I recall it, the team works on a three-weeks-long sprint) and soon to be in the Quarterly Update 1 for Team Foundation Server, there has been a nice new feature: the Kanban Board.</p> <p>Kanban is a process based on the boundaries imposed by the work-in-progress limits. Everything is in a queue, with defined states (eg. Development Ready, Test Ready, Release Ready, etc.), and the to-do jobs are governed by the capacity of the team. Ideally, this is the best way for ‘just in time’ production</p> <p>It has a fairly interesting history, as it’s been created by a Japanese man watching american stocking habits in supermarkets. More on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)">Wikipedia</a>.</p> <p>Kanban forces the team to rely on their self-control, continuously adjusting their queue based on the work they can do. Using it together with Scrum – for instance, inside the sprints – makes software development like a Swiss clock. That is my opinion, of course <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-3D1rmlO5jl0/UOnp0ffVXAI/AAAAAAAAAno/qC7Zet1BdrM/wlEmoticon-smile2.png?imgmax=800"></p> <p>How does that fit in Team Foundation Service? The Kanban Board is the main tool for adopting Kanban: it’s visual, and effective.</p> <p>In our case, it doesn’t affect the existing Backlog Board, they are complementary! Here’s what I mean:</p> <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-hownNFRxkAo/UOnp1v_x4hI/AAAAAAAAAns/mty057-jt5Y/s1600-h/image3.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-nEtok8yejhc/UOnp2x7muWI/AAAAAAAAAn4/y4bX4s7lQWA/image_thumb1.png?imgmax=800" width="467" height="201"></a></p> <p>This is a sample Backlog Board: I can see on the left my PBIs, with the inner tasks composing it, and their status.</p> <p>Here is the correspondent Kanban Board on the same project:</p> <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-NSYjDUbR6Ds/UOnp4Q3SB-I/AAAAAAAAAn8/AUz-prZ5vyY/s1600-h/image9.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Zclb5ksL0zs/UOnp5TDx03I/AAAAAAAAAoI/QpO4fk2oxvE/image_thumb5.png?imgmax=800" width="462" height="122"></a></p> <p>I can just see the User Stories, and not the linked Work Items. And as I am the only project member, I entered 1 as the maximum WIP load. So I can understand just looking at it that I am overcommitted.</p> <p>So the Backlog Board can be used to understand a finer grain load, at a task level, for my team. The Kanban Board is a useful tool for a project level inspection. They are two different tool but they might be used together <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-3D1rmlO5jl0/UOnp0ffVXAI/AAAAAAAAAno/qC7Zet1BdrM/wlEmoticon-smile2.png?imgmax=800"></p>
