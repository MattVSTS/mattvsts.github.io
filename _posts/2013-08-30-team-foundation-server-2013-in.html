<p>Microsoft scheduled a very interesting initiative for the 13-15 September: the Team Foundation Server 2013 Upgrade Weekend.</p> <p>What is that? It is a weekend where organizations can upgrade their Team Foundation Servers to the 2013 release with the latest go-live prerelease, and get free support in case of issues by the Microsoft CSS.</p> <p>I strongly suggest to join us (I am going to upgrade several instances as well, both personal and corporate), to do this you are simply required to register <a href="http://aka.ms/TFSUpgradeWeekend">here</a> so they can staff the appropriate people. </p> <p>If you need to download the previews, <a href="http://aka.ms/GetVS2013">here</a> you can find what you might need!</p>
