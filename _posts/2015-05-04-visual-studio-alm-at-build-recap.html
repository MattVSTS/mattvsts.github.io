<p>Tons of stuff at this year’s //BUILD! It was really exciting and there were a lot of news about Windows 10, Edge and the ecosystem.</p> <p>But this post is going to be about all that’s been announced for Visual Studio ALM. Brace yourselves, it is quite long :)</p> <ul> <li><strong>Visual Studio Code<br></strong>An evolution of Codename Monaco, this Electron-based <em>app</em> enables a great editing experience on not only Windows, but also <strong>MacOS</strong> and <strong>Linux</strong>. It is free and downloadable from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">here</a>.  <li><strong>SonarQube and Team Foundation Server integration<br></strong>I already started <a href="http://mattvsts.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/sq-tfsscripts-automation-scripts-for.html">working on it</a>, this is a <a href="https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-msbuild-runner">joint</a> <a href="https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet-codeanalysis">release</a> from SonarSource and Microsoft to enable a deep integration between SonarQube and Team Foundation Server so we can have the <strong>same parity</strong> as Java for <strong>Technical Debt Analysis</strong> with SonarQube. It is a very well welcomed effort, I can’t wait to bring it into several projects I have in mind.  <li><strong>Visual Studio Release Management 2015<br></strong>Some light was shed on VSRM at //BUILD, we now know that much of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2015/04/29/release-management-announcements-at-build-2015.aspx">goodness</a> of the <strong>new Release Management </strong>(with full support to Chef, Puppet and Team Build vNext) is going to be released with <strong>Team Foundation Server 2015 Update 1 </strong>or during the Summer on Visual Studio Online.  <li><strong>CodeLens<br></strong>This is quite big – CodeLens is <strong>integrated</strong> in <a href="http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/4150271-make-codelens-available-outside-of-ultimate">Visual Studio Professional 2015</a>! Plus, there are new indicators like Combined Authors, When Last Changed and support for every file type.  <li><strong>Cloud Load Test<br></strong>I can <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2015/04/29/load-test-enhancements-in-release-candidate-of-visual-studio-2015-enterprise-edition.aspx">now</a> define from <strong>where</strong> my traffic is going to be generated, so I can generate a <strong>better profile</strong> of my simulated usage.  <li><strong>REST API and Service Hooks for Team Foundation Server 2015<br></strong>As Visual Studio Online and Team Foundation Server share <strong>the same codebase</strong>, we are going to get both <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2015/05/01/extensions-for-visual-studio-online-rest-apis-for-tfs-2015-rc-and-more-from-build-2015.aspx">REST APIs</a> and <a href="http://mattvsts.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/visual-studio-online-and-service-hooks.html">Service Hooks</a>!  <li><strong>Extensions for Visual Studio Online</strong><br>Based on the existing REST APIs, Visual Studio Online is going to boast a brand new <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2015/05/01/extensions-for-visual-studio-online-rest-apis-for-tfs-2015-rc-and-more-from-build-2015.aspx"><strong>extension</strong></a><strong> capability</strong>.  <li><strong>Application Insights in Public Preview</strong><br><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2015/04/29/introducing-visual-studio-code-visual-studio-2015-rc-application-insights-public-preview-and-net-core-for-linux-and-mac.aspx">Oh yes</a>, Application Insights is in Public Preview now! And with additional capabilities – a better <strong>Java</strong> support, <strong>iOS and Android</strong> devices as first-class citizens, a new shiny integration in <strong>Eclipse and XCode</strong>!  <li><strong>IntelliTest<br></strong>Do you remember <a href="http://mattvsts.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/reducing-technical-debt-with-smart-unit.html">Smart Unit Tests</a>? Well, the name wasn’t as good as it seemed to be, so it is now <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2015-vs?CR_CC=200626819#Testing">IntelliTest</a> (like IntelliSense and IntelliTrace). There are two additional features now – <strong>Parametrized Unit Tests</strong> (you can define your data properties for the generated tests) and a <strong>Create Unit Tests menu</strong>.  <li><strong>Developer Assistant<br></strong>The Developer Assistant <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2015/04/30/github-integration-in-developer-assistant.aspx">gets</a> full access to the enormous amount of code hosted on <strong>GitHub</strong>! 21 millions of examples to browse.  <li><strong>GitHub extension as a Managed Hosting Provider</strong><br>GitHub enters Visual Studio as a new <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2015/04/30/announcing-the-github-extension-for-visual-studio.aspx">Managed Hosting Provider</a>, so you can have a <strong>seamless integration</strong> inside the IDE like if it is Visual Studio Online or Team Foundation Server.  <li><strong>Improved Git branches and history views<br></strong>The integration of Git into Visual Studio proceeds, the <strong>branching view</strong> and the <strong>history view</strong> get <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2015-vs?CR_CC=200626819#VersionControl">lots of love</a>, making it way easier to use on a daily basis. <li><strong>Team Projects Rename<br></strong>Ten years later, we finally get <a title="Team project rename" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/news/tfs2015-vs#tpr">Team Project rename</a> in Team Foundation Server! This is a fantastic milestone (as it required lots of rework under the covers)! <li><strong>Improved Build vNext preview</strong><br><a title="Team Build preview" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/news/tfs2015-vs#vNextBuild">Team Build preview</a> is more aligned to the <strong>latest bits</strong> running on Visual Studio Online, it is a lot more stable and there are several new features in the web UI.</li></ul> <p>There is actually more, this is just a quick feature recap. For instance I purposely left out the Agile Boards improvements in Team Foundation Server, as I believe it is pretty clear it is being ported from Visual Studio Online to the on-premise product. In case you still have doubts, have a look at the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/release-archive-vso.aspx">Visual Studio Online and Team Foundation Server Feature Timeline</a>. </p> <p>Eventually, it is worth having a look at the Release Notes <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/news/tfs2015-vs ">for TFS</a> and <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2015-vs">Visual Studio</a>.</p>
