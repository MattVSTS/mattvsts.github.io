<p>This week Microsoft made published <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/release-archive-vso.aspx">an update</a> to the Team Foundation Server and Visual Studio Team Services roadmap, and it looks very promising.</p> <p>As we already know, TFS and VSTS are an ever evolving platform. This is true for both on-premise with regular updates delivered roughly every quarter and for the cloud service, where the new features are always delivered first.</p> <p>There are already a few set of features slated for TFS vNext – this is neither a surprise nor a defeat admission, the amount of work for such features is very big – think at the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2016/01/11/process-customization-futures.aspx">listed</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2016/01/11/vsts-new-work-item-form-futures-january-2016.aspx">improvements</a> for Work Item Tracking alone.</p> <p>But it isn’t everything for vNext – there is a lot coming in Update 2 and Update 3 as well. The Lab Management overhaul is one of these features, coming in Update 2, like extensions on-premise and the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2016/01/08/vsts-release-management-plan-for-2016-h1.aspx">new Release Management</a>.</p> <p>Keep an eye on that page for TFS and VSTS, because it is updated on a regular basis and it is a great source of information for planning well in advance.</p>
