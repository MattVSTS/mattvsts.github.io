title: GitHub Well-Architected, the ultimate guide to enterprise-grade GitHub deployments
tags: [platform]

Speaking with people the other day I realised so many don't know about it!

In January GitHub released their [Well-Architected guide](https://wellarchitected.github.com/library/overview/layers/). Clearly inspired by the Azure Well Architected Framework, it is a proper guide to setting up an enterprise-grade development platform, going well beyond pure tools and rather into design principles and ways of working.

It is an invaluable piece of documentation, so you can assess where you are against best practices and potentially add or improve some of your practices.
