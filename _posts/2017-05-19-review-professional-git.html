<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I am asked at least twice in three months about a good book on Git.<br /><br />Despite the information available at <cite><a href="https://git-scm.com/book">https://git-scm.com/book</a></cite> is very  comprehensive, there is value out of a published book to be consumed as a  reference, especially when onboarding a new team member or when you <em>finally  </em>want to get a firm grip on this (sometimes dreaded) Version Control  System.<br /><br />So I contacted Wrox to get a copy of Professional Git, which was published in  December 2016 hence it is not only a reference book but also an updated  reference book.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Q8Q4Ej95jSc/WR60hm9a8gI/AAAAAAAAEdE/bQHfuQ2T5Mc5Gx1P4Edawbmnmoi8gpf5wCLcB/s1600/DSC_0096.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Q8Q4Ej95jSc/WR60hm9a8gI/AAAAAAAAEdE/bQHfuQ2T5Mc5Gx1P4Edawbmnmoi8gpf5wCLcB/s400/DSC_0096.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />You might wonder why is this so important to me. Well, it is fairly simple after  all. Git became a mainstream tool a few years ago, but its history goes much  further back. Documentation on its usage might be older, aimed at advanced users  or fragmented, so it is important to have a book not only covering all the  important topics, but crucially covering them from the right point of view.<br /><br />Brent Laster did a brilliant job with this book. I felt the level of depth  was perfect, neither too shallow nor too deep. Topics like Submodules – often  troublesome for some and quite challenging anyway – are covered with a clarity  that would make the essential information memorable.<br /><br />The book has companion exercises and labs to keep you busy if you are a total  newbie. If you are a bit more experienced it is still very valuable, putting  down in plain language with straightforward samples even the trickiest of  topics. <br />       <br />Just remember that the syntax used for the examples is UNIX-style – hence  lots of ls!&nbsp;But aside from that I cannot refrain from suggesting it to who wants to start  with Git and is looking for a comprehensive guide.</div>
