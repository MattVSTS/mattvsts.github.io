<p>I started to look at HockeyApp recently, and I reckon it is quite an impressive piece of software. Microsoft acquired it in 2014, and now they are pitching it as the solution for Application Monitoring for <em>apps</em>, regardless of the platform, while Application Insights is the APM solution for web application and services.</p> <p>With that in mind, the first thing we need to know is that we need to join HockeyApp’s Preseason program – it is an early access program (they are quite into hockey over there <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dppRMiqIXDU/Vwzkjh5lNAI/AAAAAAAADAg/Xw6NfDihixs/wlEmoticon-smile2.png?imgmax=800">). With that you will get access to the UWP support but also to another key feature: custom events.</p> <p>The thing with HockeyApp is that being an app-centric tool the main usage scenario they developed the product around is when the app crashes in an <strong>unmanaged</strong> way.</p> <p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-w8DpxgEWLjU/VwzkkiNe92I/AAAAAAAADAo/exJ7iCsTps4/s1600-h/image2.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mvJGJsBvcZU/VwzklYEzyAI/AAAAAAAADAw/QsAtNv3E9Mk/image_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="191" height="244"></a></p> <p><strong>Unmanaged</strong> is key here: without Preseason SDK (NuGet package actually) you can only gather crash data at the next application launch. And what if I would like to collect data from exceptions I manage on my own?</p> <p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pq_5BgpFzLA/VwzkmaPa0jI/AAAAAAAADA4/LOYHalepPpA/s1600-h/image5.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TsBh3FLx2HM/VwzknfGipII/AAAAAAAADBA/ylkmLV3i8-Y/image_thumb1%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="244" height="237"></a></p> <p>That is where Custom Events come around. They are not as descriptive as unmanaged exceptions (HockeyApp collects stack trace data, device information, etc.) but they are a very handy way of keeping track of this important data distribution.</p> <p>The exception management strategy here becomes two-folded: unhandled exceptions go straight to HockeyApp <em>with all the trimmings</em>, while instead you need to separately log the exception data you need when you manage to catch them, and then send the relevant event to HockeyApp.</p> <p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--g3vam0Vtng/VwzkoThetlI/AAAAAAAADBI/r9rFSvW8-Ds/s1600-h/image3%25255B1%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-szFaajnnYlA/VwzkpUQs4LI/AAAAAAAADBQ/zLhPp1X9qcY/image_thumb1.png?imgmax=800" width="244" height="101"></a></p> <p>In the future I am expecting features to be added from both Application Insights and Xamarin Insights to HockeyApp. The latter two teams <a href="https://www.xamarin.com/insights">merged</a> as of a few weeks ago, and this can only reinforce an already very good platform.</p>
