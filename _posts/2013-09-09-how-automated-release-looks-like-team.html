Well, when it comes to the <strong>Automated Release</strong> our <em>beloved</em> Team Foundation Build has not so much to do…apart from hers usual stuff, with a slightly different Build Process Template.<br />For enabling an Automated Release, you have to add a custom Template and create a Build Definition using it. You are going to find it into the <strong>InRelease installation folder </strong>(…\InCycle Software\InRelease\Bin).<br /><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-YRgX9lPOBsc/Uhu8UzBA58I/AAAAAAAABLE/nD6t291_anI/s1600-h/image%25255B5%25255D.png"><img alt="image" border="0" height="96" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-K9LV7fO5U20/Uhu8VRI6OlI/AAAAAAAABLI/cup3T-54Y6w/image_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border: 0px currentColor; display: inline; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="image" width="244" /></a><br />You are going to notice that there is a dedicated InRelease section for its parameters. If <strong>Release Build</strong> is set to <strong>True</strong> you are going to deploy the build. <br />You can set a <strong>Release Target Stage</strong> – if needed. Leaving it blank will make it go through all the possible stages unless stopped - and a specific <strong>Configuration to Release – </strong>leveraging the same configurations you might use in the Configuration Manager.<br />Every component must be configured to <strong>Build with Application </strong>or <strong>Build Externally</strong>. A <strong>Build Independently</strong> component won’t work. This is a known limitation of InRelease.<br />And obviously, both <strong>Acceptance Step </strong>and <strong>Deployment Step </strong>of the very first stage of the associated release path must be <strong>Automated</strong>.<br />The main task it does is the <strong>Configuration File Tokenization</strong>. This feature, together with a specific syntax into the configuration files themselves (usually <strong>__VALUE__</strong>), makes a build-time transformation based on the target stage.<br /><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-I1-kYSsXNkU/Uhu8VuZASjI/AAAAAAAABLQ/PGNZ7hunaBA/s1600-h/image%25255B8%25255D.png"><img alt="image" border="0" height="244" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-sOUXoyHheFk/Uhu8WG1A3lI/AAAAAAAABLY/jn7wxQ6HpNI/image_thumb%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border: 0px currentColor; display: inline; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="image" width="233" /></a><br />For achieving this, it is needed to install the <strong>Client Component</strong> of InRelease on the Build Server.<br />It is not something that hard or trivial – you can integrate these specific tasks into a pre-existing customized Build Template so you are going to get a single template if you need.<br />After that, the InRelease <strong>Release Service</strong> is invoked, and everything passes through that, with the related configurations and settings.
