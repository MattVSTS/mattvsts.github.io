<p>If you are trying to use Test Manager to record a manual test with a web application and then play it back, you might find a nasty issue while inputting stuff: the error <strong>“Cannot perform 'SetProperty of Text with value "value"' on the hidden control.”.</strong></p> <p>It is caused by the Microsoft Security Update MS13-069 (KB2870699), which introduces several security fixes as well as this strange behaviour.</p> <p>To fix it and correctly playback the test, you would need to install the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40338">latest</a> Update of Visual Studio 2012 or use Visual Studio 2013 which is not affected. </p>
