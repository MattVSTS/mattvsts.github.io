<p>The Scrum of Scrums is often saw as something ‘which grew out of control’, ‘just for Scrum Masters’ or something suited just to very large organizations.</p> <p>It isn’t, actually…and it’s not <em>rocket science</em>, either.</p> <p>A Scrum of Scrums is the best possible way of clearing doubts and questions raised <strong>among teams</strong>. It must not be merged or confused with a <em>bigger standup meeting</em> (as I’ve heard it…) because it is something brought on by the teams’ representatives – the Scrum Masters.</p> <p>Its scope is to get a clear understanding of the problem’s domain and provide a solution – as the Scrum Master is there <strong>to remove impediments</strong>.</p> <p>And yes: a Scrum of Scrums can have its own backlog, Jeff Sutherland defines the Scrum of Scrums as “<em>…an operational delivery mechanism</em>”, so having a backlog is perfectly reasonable.</p>
