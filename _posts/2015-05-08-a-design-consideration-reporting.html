<p>There are a few bits of any Team Foundation Server deployment which are either taken for granted, or completely ignored. One of them is:</p> <blockquote> <p><em><strong>Why shall I install SQL Server Reporting Services on the Application Tier?</strong></em></p></blockquote> <p>Fair question, if you are not considering installing it on a separate box – a different approach, usually not as common as the former.</p> <p>The idea is to centralise all the client-originated HTTP traffic on <strong>a single endpoint</strong>. The endpoint of course can be a cluster address where you have multiple SSRS servers and Application Tiers, but the concept is the same. Centralise your traffic, possibly using <strong><a href="http://www.edsquared.com/2011/01/03/Using+Friendly+DNS+Names+In+Your+TFS+Environment.aspx">DNS names</a></strong>. The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb552243.aspx">documentation</a> suggest that too:</p> <p><a href="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wRK-PeOKGlE/VUybPlADqFI/AAAAAAAAB-k/fj57xlmw6Zo/s1600-h/image%25255B4%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sTzM66OpzyU/VUybQWFzXDI/AAAAAAAAB-o/K5Gn5bJBexo/image_thumb%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="584" height="77"></a> </p> <p>so that the data tier is exactly that: <strong>the storage</strong> for Team Foundation Server’s (and related, if you want) databases.</p> <p>Beware: it is not <strong>wrong</strong> to install it on the data tier (it is actually supported since Team Foundation Server 2008), but it is a matter of best practices.</p>
