We have seen how to fix the gap between development and operation teams in a quick&amp;dirty way. There is a lot more to do, and tons of tools which can help us: the main one is IntelliTrace.<br />When we create an Operational Issue, an IntelliTrace log is attached to the work item itself:<br /><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-rhCC-MMTzdE/UUeIuMy5FhI/AAAAAAAAAzo/qqv855HV1NU/s1600-h/image3.png"><img alt="image" border="0" height="104" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-q30HnOwtgcY/UUeIvnkzpEI/AAAAAAAAAzw/fk_NAOT5JDs/image_thumb1.png?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-width: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="image" width="466" /></a><br />but it features just the minimum subset of information related to the alert.<br />The first way would be manually get a .iTrace file with our custom collector. Nothing that difficult, but if the main motto of DevOps is “automate everything”, we are going against it.<br />Or – way better – I can ask the Ops folks to record a detailed IntelliTrace log, of course everything integrated with Team Foundation Server. It’s just needed to set the work item to “awaiting evidence” with a resolution note telling them to provide me a better IntelliTrace log:<br /><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-nbgk_EVpKwA/UUeIwSaHZ1I/AAAAAAAAAz0/a8nrwfGAnYU/s1600-h/devops52.png"><img alt="devops5" border="0" height="158" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-b8A7brQ8s7U/UUeIxRCktKI/AAAAAAAAA0A/YA1h1V9XFas/devops5_thumb.png?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-width: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="devops5" width="244" /></a><br />Then the Ops guy is going to use the <strong>IntelliTrace Tasks </strong>tab to gather what Engineering wants. Definitely easy!<br /><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-yXzUEdawL2Y/UUeIyR5Lk0I/AAAAAAAAA0I/i84XRp3CnBw/s1600-h/image6.png"><img alt="image" border="0" height="146" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-ZMJ7z4g0Ico/UUeIzeu5UyI/AAAAAAAAA0Q/lODO1k8l7cY/image_thumb2.png?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-width: 0px; display: inline; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="image" width="213" /></a><br />He can collect a snapshot of the current state of the involved application pool, or better he can start collecting a new IntelliTrace file, replicating/let someone replicate the scenario on behalf of the user, and then the new IntelliTrace file is going to be attached to the related Work Item.<br />All the IntelliTrace files are going to be stored into a network share, one folder for each alert, so remember to keep an eye on the storage size!
