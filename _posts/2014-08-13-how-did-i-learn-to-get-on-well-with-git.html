<p>Who knows me certainly know I am not the biggest…err…fan of Git <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Smile" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-H3Bcr103GC4/U-vRGc-2V_I/AAAAAAAABjE/302HdmPVays/wlEmoticon-smile2.png?imgmax=800"></p> <p>Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/Alkampfer">Gian Maria</a> and its <em>continuous support</em> on it I managed to understand how Git works and why it is so powerful. I am not saying it is “better than” something else – it is different and it has some pros and some cons.</p> <p>So, it’s distributed. Distributed does not mean anarchist – it means <strong>distributed</strong>. If you want to have some sort of centralisation, go for a <strong>Remote</strong>. You can use it as a shared repository to be used like a central depot without losing any advantage of the DVCS concept.</p> <p>When you <strong>commit</strong> something is different than when you <strong>push</strong> something. A commit is local, a push is toward a Remote.</p> <p>A <strong>Git Fetch </strong>gets all the objects from the Remote which are not in your local repository. A <strong>Git Pull</strong> does more: it merges those files on your local repository, like a <strong>Get Latest Version.</strong></p> <p>Eventually – install <a href="www.sourcetreeapp.com">SourceTree</a>. It’s an amazing GUI tool with a fantastic branch visualisation tool.</p>
