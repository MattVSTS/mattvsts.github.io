But I still recommend it, because of its role as a <em>one size fits all</em> overview of the development stack we use these days.</p> <p>It is still worth it if you need a reference on your shelve (like I do <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2zKlltyfjuk/V5DKr4Xqg5I/AAAAAAAADpk/kHue7CulmCI/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800">), or because it also has good and quick code examples. Eventually I realised one of the biggest improvement is the size of the font from last version’s – it is more <em>readable</em>.</p>
