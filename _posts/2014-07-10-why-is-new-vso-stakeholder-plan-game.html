<p>Yesterday Brian Harry <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2014/07/09/upcoming-vs-online-licensing-changes.aspx">announced</a> the new Visual Studio Online Stakeholder Plan – basically, full access to Work Items only in Visual Studio Online (and on-premise Team Foundation Server) for everybody, free of charge.</p> <p>I believe this is a true game changer: it’s at least four years that we talk about ‘<strong>involving stakeholders in the process</strong>’, ‘<strong>synergy among the parts in the organization</strong>’, <strong>Product Owners</strong>, etc. We could do that, for a fee (the Visual Studio Online plan or the on-premise TFS CAL) but it was perceived as a bit <em>unfair </em>against who could use that CAL/plan at full power (a developer would use all the features provided by the platform, a stakeholder certainly wouldn’t, 99% of the time).</p> <p>Right now there are no <em>excuses</em> anymore <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Smile" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-c0g3SSSUr2Y/U75TgmlfQPI/AAAAAAAABiY/Y3LX-Akhurg/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800"> as you can involve as many stakeholders as you wish <strong>without paying a penny</strong>. </p> <p>As there are <a href="http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2001/04/s4058.pdf">evidences</a> of how involving stakeholders in the development process is a staggering improvement compared to other methodologies, it is a great opportunity to push hard on the quality pedal and starting to achieve great results!</p>
