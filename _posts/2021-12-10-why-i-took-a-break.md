title: Why I took a break from blogging
tags: [personal]
---
For the past fifteen years I've been blogging with regularity, at least once a month. This blog starts with entries from 2012, however I've been blogging for far longer.  

I just needed a bit of a break, as this year has been particularly tough: the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, so much going on at work and even more outside of it. 

Work has been a source of continuous inspiration and kept me fed with challenges and motivation - the type of work I do brings me ever closer to the core business problems we all aim to solve, and one of my core goals is people development. I love working on people's development and being able to steer organisations to the best possible path they can take.  

Community didn't take a backseat - I am planning to restart the London Microsoft DevOps Meetup with Tarun, and we are already planning for GDBC 2022. I also managed to (virtually) participate to several events this year, and spending time with the folks organising DDD has been as amazing as always. I slowed down a fair bit, but I didn't lose touch with the amazing technical communities worldwide. Events have been rescheduled, cancelled, moved - however stuff got done!

Outside of work, again so much going on. Who is close know how much happened in 2021, and how much effort went into all of these things.  

The result is that, unfortunately, blogging slowed down. I had way less time to do so, and most importantly I just didn't have the energy to dedicate myself to the amount of experimentation and writing I used to do, as a result for the past three months I didn't publish anything.  

Things will hopefully change, with a couple of big holidays coming up (to recharge!) and a number of things already listed in my neverending notebook. You will soon hear back from me, and I will start touching on some less beaten topics in the software engineering world. But for now, I am enjoying a little break :-)
