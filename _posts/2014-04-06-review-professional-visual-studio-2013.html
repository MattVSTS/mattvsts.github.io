Fair enough – it is an updated overview of the Microsoft development stack. This is enough to justify it in full.</p> <p>Bruce Johnson (Visual C# MVP) refreshed the 2012 one, covering a huge (1050 pages) amount of topics. Of course it is not a deep dive style book, it is not its target, but it gives the right amount of information on everything surrounds the core topic – Visual Studio itself.</p> <p>To summarize in one idea: <strong>if you see something in the IDE, it is covered here.</strong></p> <p>Again at the end, Visual Studio Ultimate and Team Foundation Server are separately reviewed in order to avoid <em>polluting</em> the core stuff. A great choice I fully back, by the way.</p> <p>It is a book every developer should have on the shelf, because sometimes picking up a specific chapter is better than just searching on the MSDN or a search engine.</p>
