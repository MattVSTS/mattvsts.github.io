<p>Git log is a <em>special</em> command, it uses a pager and it seems the PowerShell ISE <strong>hangs</strong> when you run into that kind of commands. If you try creating a script relying on running git log in whatever form, you won’t get anything.</p> <p>The workaround is not the very best, but it does the trick:</p> <p>$logcommand = "git --no-pager log ... [&gt; file.ext if needed]" <br>Invoke-Expression $log</p> <p>Other commands like git diff are <strong>not affected</strong> by this. This made me lose quite a bit of time this morning…but I am happy to be unblocked now.</p>
