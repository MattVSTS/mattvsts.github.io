I had to talk about that so it is worth to share it there as well!<br />One of the pillars of Continuous Delivery is the broad usage of Feature Flags in the code.<br />What’s that? It is a concept introduced by Flickr in their pioneering usage of DevOps and Continuous Delivery, and supported by <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html">Martin Fowler</a> as well. To keep it simple, let's make an example: everybody has a control panel at home for electricity. The control panel complexity may vary – it could be simply on-off, or be shaped to split every single room of the house with one switch each. These switches are the Feature Flags.<br />I guess it is pretty obvious to understand why they should be used. With them, you are improving testability, troubleshooting, and facilitating the incremental shipping.<br />Of course technology is not everything. You should be backed by a very solid process, otherwise the tentative of being <a href="http://code.flickr.net/2009/12/02/flipping-out/">Flickr</a>-like (no branches and just feature toggles) would be a bloodbath..<br />An easy way of starting could be as it follows:<br /><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-QIpF7oJn1bs/Ub7fCZW2LsI/AAAAAAAAA98/7iJWY724-fc/s1600-h/image%25255B2%25255D.png"><img alt="image" border="0" height="90" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-TibsvF2sGhU/Ub7fDPjtnhI/AAAAAAAAA-E/OgXyOHN4z5w/image_thumb.png?imgmax=800" style="border: 0px currentColor; display: inline;" title="image" width="172" /></a> <a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-0jQmHpIIYDc/Ub7fDmOalAI/AAAAAAAAA-M/BCREKSpxNqo/s1600-h/image%25255B5%25255D.png"><img alt="image" border="0" height="129" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-0ow1UTte8C0/Ub7fESFmRxI/AAAAAAAAA-U/lwPCBMKF5Pg/image_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800" style="border: 0px currentColor; display: inline;" title="image" width="244" /></a> <br />It is a beginning, we can use Feature Branches to develop features (separation of concerns, modularization design patterns apply here) and merge them to the <em>main</em> development branch. Fairly easy and fairly classic I’d say.<br />Now let’s go a bit more into the code. As a sample I am using a WinRT App, leveraging on FeatureToggle as a helper. <a href="https://github.com/jason-roberts/FeatureToggle">FeatureToggle</a> is a nice OSS library which enables Feature Flags in a very easy way, it was the easiest to set up (NuGet package) and use. And moreover, it works on Windows Desktop, WinRT and Windows Phone. Definitely worth a try IMHO. But keep in mind it is just a sample, with no willing of be production-ready :)<br />I created two classes with my <em>features </em>inside – I wanted to do the easiest possible example, so don’t mind about the code’s silliness – which implement one of the OOB toggles, simply an Interface. <br />After this, in the MainPage() I would set (for the example, because in WinRT there are no .config files. In a webapp I would <strong>read</strong> the web.config file instead) the available features - and of course in the FF.Dev I would get the <strong>Yes</strong> and <strong>No</strong> features because of the merge from the feature branches – and then the bounded controls would be instantiated.<br /><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ycER0hJaEIU/Ub7fE2elaVI/AAAAAAAAA-c/DcXVPT16ypU/s1600-h/image%25255B9%25255D.png"><img alt="image" border="0" height="124" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-thlJWXDwAzk/Ub7fFfXP8JI/AAAAAAAAA-k/MnDCSsd3bQo/image_thumb%25255B3%25255D.png?imgmax=800" style="border: 0px currentColor; display: inline;" title="image" width="545" /></a> <br />If I do not want to enable the <strong>Yes</strong> feature, I just have to set its configuration value to <strong>false</strong>, and despite the code is there, it won’t be available to the user. Which is exactly the target of Feature Flags.<br /><br />Just run the application with the settings you want, and you would get the result. In case of a <em>old-fashioned</em> web application or whatever else, you can rely on XML files (and their transformations, if needed) for configurations.
