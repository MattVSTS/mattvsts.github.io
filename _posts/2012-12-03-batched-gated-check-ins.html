<p>A <i>subtle</i> new feature in Team Build 2012 is the possibility of batching the gated check-ins workflow, which enables you to “sum up” your check-ins and let the Team Build elaborate them together.  <p>It’s available under the Gated Check-in trigger in the Build Definition configuration:  <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-l08LdavfKoY/ULxmr03AKxI/AAAAAAAAAlg/hlRU9ST88W4/s1600-h/image3.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-1M2AZM3aTcw/ULxmsxbQB8I/AAAAAAAAAlo/QqCmigRNDNY/image_thumb1.png?imgmax=800" width="488" height="95"></a>  <p>Then, what happens if one of the queued builds fail? No problem, they are going to be sequentially reinitialized and individually elaborated, in order to avoid further problems.  <p>It’s a feature which finds its fit just inside big teams, I admit it…but it can still be useful even in other scenarios.
