Often many people think that as the Team Foundation Server Integration Platform is an open-source project, it has no support.<br /><br /><strong><u>WRONG!</u></strong><br /><strong><u></u></strong><br />It is the only Microsoft supported solution for all the migration needs you might have. <br /><strong>But only if you download the Visual Studio Gallery <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/eb77e739-c98c-4e36-9ead-fa115b27fefe">package</a></strong>, which is the stable and supported version. If you have an issue with it, you can raise a call to the Customer Support Service.<br /><br />If you download the Codeplex <a href="http://tfsintegration.codeplex.com/">package</a> (with the source code), you might get the betas, which are obviously not supported.<br /><br />I hope this clarifies a bit around this really important topic <img alt="Smile" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-GPIaLnSucHo/UVs4RR5ejRI/AAAAAAAAA1A/robvZYpEw8s/wlEmoticon-smile2.png?imgmax=800" />
