title: Ten years of MVP Award
tags: [thoughts]
---
Today is an important day. Today is Renewal Day for a sizeable amount of the Microsoft MVP population, and I [was renewed](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4027206?fullName=Matteo%20Emili) as well for the 10th year in a row.

Ten years is a very long time...why do I keep doing everything I do (which eventually can bring to the Award, but never the other way around)? Because I love it.

I love running a [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/London-Microsoft-DevOps/), despite massive drop rates and a perennial struggle for attendance. I just organised [Global DevOps Bootcamp 2019](https://mattvsts.github.io/2019/06/16/postmortem-of-the-global-devops-bootcamp-2019/) in London, which was a huge experience. I just love meeting people and listening to their experience while sharing mine, over the years I became friends with a huge amount of people, and being an MVP became an enriching experience at a deeply personal level.

I am a founding member of [several](https://www.domusdotnet.org/) [other](https://www.meetup.com/Taunton-and-area-Developers-Meetup/) [communities](http://www.getlatestversion.it/) all over Europe, and I travel at my own expense (except if the conference has paid for tickets!) to speak anywhere I can find a stage, large or small. I do it because I believe that sharing is the cornerstone of cultural growth, and I try to venture in new territories whenever possible. It is also an excellent excuse to travel and visit new places :-)

I started my first few [open-source contributions](https://github.com/mattvsts) this year, and I hope I will pick them up again whenever I have time. I have a huge mountain to climb in that regard, but I am not giving up on that...it is still part of the sharing concept above.

All in all, it's been a fantastic ride. Let's turn this corner, and keep going.
