title: GitHub Copilot Spaces is your rubber duck

The GitHub ecosystem keeps growing and GitHub Copilot has got a new, preview feature... that looks like a product. [Copilot Spaces](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-29-introducing-copilot-spaces-a-new-way-to-work-with-code-and-context/).

It's a brilliant tool to go beyond code, and use it as a [rubber duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com) in any situation. Think where you need to search large amount of documentation, or code. 

For example, I have 13 years of posts in my blog. I might not need to index all of them, but rather just the past few years. I created a Space just for that...

I gave it some system instructions to ensure its behavior is very tailored, then ingested the past few years of posts, leaving room for growth:

And that's all: I can start prompting! With my model of choice, of course:

Of course this is a super-simple scenario. However imagine you need to brainstorm an idea or discuss something with a colleague... Spaces gives you that environment. It's similar to [Copilot Workspaces](https://mattvsts.github.io/2024/11/09/copilot-workspace-brainstorming/) in many ways, but with more flexibility around how you use it.
