title: Review - DevOps for the Modern Enterprise
tags: [books]

It's been a while since my last book review - unfortunately I did not read any work-related book for the last few months, and that dried up a fair bit.

That said, I just finished Mirco Hering's _DevOps for the Modern Enterprise_ and I think it is a great one.

It's a very good book for several reasons, but the one that resonates the most with me is that all the mentioned approaches and situations are definitely from the real world: I've been through similar scenarios and I am facing some of them even right now.

Stuff like the use of the _strangler pattern_ for org-wide applications reviews for example, it's something that is really tried-and-tested - or on how to manage the relationship with your team (_resources_, a term neither of us really get on well with). I am sure anyone in a management position will find benefit from that, and there is also a nice section at the end about the technology trends and aspects that are getting traction these days. It is really a nice all-around view on real world DevOps and Continuous Delivery.

That said the book goes way beyond the traditional DevOps angle, and Mirco is very good at widening the angle at which he is applying the suggestions. From a technology perspective, the book defines regular patterns you can apply to a variety of situations, and it is very broad in reach so anybody can find something valuable out of these pages. It's very much a collection of advices coming from real life examples, for the good and the bad. I can really recommend it.
