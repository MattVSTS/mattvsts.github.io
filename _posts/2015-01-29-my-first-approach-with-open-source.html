<p>To be fair, I’ve never been involved in open-source very much. I mean, personally. Moreover, I have always been quite shy of my <em>stuff</em>, as nowadays I mostly write scripts and no longer full-fledged production applications.</p> <p>But anyway I decided to give it a go. So please, <strong>do not shoot the pianist</strong>, alright? :)</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/MattVSTS/TFSThemeUploader"><strong>TFSThemeUploader</strong></a> is a simple PowerShell script aimed at automating the scenario described in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn306083.aspx">this</a> MSDN article. I’ve always thought it is quite tedious to manually complete, as it requires a bit of fiddling around XML and command-line tools. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it, but when you need to perform the same actions for more than one or two projects it isn’t very…compelling – hence the script.</p> <p>I might expand it actually, to make it a bit more user-friendly and to expand the possible scenarios, I have a couple of ideas. But for the meantime, it is a good start I think.</p>
