<p>As somebody knows, I am going to relocate in a few weeks in the United Kingdom. It’s a dream I had since I was a child, which now becomes true <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-ECWP6wG5RS4/US89Ms0U_dI/AAAAAAAAAwM/aNzcjxtHyEY/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800"></p> <p>I am going to relocate in Taunton, Somerset – working for Quest Software (acquired by Dell in September 2012) as a Team Foundation Server Administrator for their Visual Studio ALM platform. It’s not only that, but for some more details I have to start working for them <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-ECWP6wG5RS4/US89Ms0U_dI/AAAAAAAAAwM/aNzcjxtHyEY/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800"> around five weeks to go, though.</p> <p>But the fun is not over: with the relocation I also have to change my country as a MVP. So I am going to be a UK MVP, and I am surely going to have the pleasure of working with <a href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile=59FE5790-D13C-40D8-9E99-B82DE635E4EE">Richard Fennell</a>, <a href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile=DEEDC820-BDF1-4E4F-A034-5F1869050B3D">Mike Fourie</a>, all the other UK &amp; Ireland MVPs and my new MVP Lead Claire Smyth!</p> <p>So, now I only have to complete the toughest part of the job: packing everything and doing the move! And the best is yet to come <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Winking smile" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-_ZSe-Y9Jcx0/US89Nin97II/AAAAAAAAAwU/1H4H56Y2LCI/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800"></p>
