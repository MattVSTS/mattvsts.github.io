<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Like I said in my <a href="https://mattvsts.blogspot.com/2018/07/a-set-of-tools-to-deal-with-granular.html">last post</a>, I really enjoy using <a href="https://vsts-bulk-editor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">VSTS Sync Migrator</a>&nbsp;for Work Item migrations.<br />There are a few reasons why I believe this tool stands out from the rest, and it is not just because of its complexity - in a nutshell, you can use it not just for tip migrations, but to actually filter and sanitise what you are importing into your target TFS or VSTS.<br /><br />Firstly, you can run each processor (call them <i>steps</i>&nbsp;if you want) independently. That is very important when it comes to understanding what each one of them does. You don't really want to use something that starts, does <i>stuff</i>&nbsp;and then fails with an enormous log file.<br /><br />Each processor is extremely specialised and usually backed by a WIQL - again, quite complex sometimes but extremely powerful and flexible.<br /><br />You can also run multiple instances of the Migrator, targeting different Team Projects in VSTS - having them side by side isn't usually a problem.<br /><br />Then, you have a really powerful capability for shaping your data in the best possible way. By "shaping" I mean "mapping": field to field, replacing values, even replacing values via Regular Expressions or mapping different Work Item Types.<br /><br />This can enable all sorts of scenarios where you can change a Process Template, or make your very verbose customised form much more readable by merging or moving around fields' data.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-e1D1AjUzWDw/W2yr_Z4ssDI/AAAAAAAAE9E/_tEni84LwjErJEg9M-Ote_WGYN2i98uIQCLcBGAs/s1600/sync.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="922" data-original-width="1012" height="364" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-e1D1AjUzWDw/W2yr_Z4ssDI/AAAAAAAAE9E/_tEni84LwjErJEg9M-Ote_WGYN2i98uIQCLcBGAs/s400/sync.PNG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Eventually, no ancillary item is left behind, including Work Item Queries (which carry a huge business value IMHO) and commit information. You can link commits to Work Items even if you migrated the repository with a different name.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CtdwmwZZFIg/W2ysowD-xBI/AAAAAAAAE9M/hoOQjjZBXlEVrs2qS0e1TRyCPrD6PufSACLcBGAs/s1600/extra.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="300" data-original-width="1077" height="110" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CtdwmwZZFIg/W2ysowD-xBI/AAAAAAAAE9M/hoOQjjZBXlEVrs2qS0e1TRyCPrD6PufSACLcBGAs/s400/extra.PNG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />It takes a while to get all the bits right - there are lots of options, but the <a href="https://vsts-bulk-editor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/">documentation </a>is quite good and it will easily guide you through. Fellow MVP Mohamed Radwan also recorded a <a href="http://mohamedradwan.com/2017/09/15/tfs-2017-migration-to-vsts-with-vsts-sync-migrator/">quick demo</a> of how to use it.<br /><br />Now, onto more VSTS migrations ðŸ˜€<br /><br /></div>
