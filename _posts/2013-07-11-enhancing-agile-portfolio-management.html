<p>Yesterday the Team Foundation Service team <a href="http://tfs.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/2013-jul-10">released</a> the Sprint 50 build, and one of the features shipped is the Backlog Mapping.</p> <p>Nothing too big or hard to explain: if you are creating a Portfolio within Team Foundation Service, you would surely get a flat list of Features and a flat list of PBI/User Stories.</p> <p>With the Backlog Mapping (which is just a pane on the right side), you can drag&amp;drop the PBI you want to be child of a certain Feature, and it is going to be automatically linked. </p> <p>It is a very nice and effective feature, which combines a strong User Experience with a tangible result.</p>
