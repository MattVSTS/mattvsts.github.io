<p>The ALM Rangers just <a href="http://vsarupgradeguide.codeplex.com/">released</a> the v3 of the TFS Upgrade Guide. Apart from the official announcement, etc., I wanted to give you a valid reason to download and use it if you are still sceptic.</p> <p>Scenarios. This guide covers a handful lot of <strong>real world </strong>scenarios, like the upgrade from 2008 or different configurations. So it is not just a basic walkthrough, but it provides you a robust sample from people who already experienced the aforementioned scenarios.</p> <p>Give it a try, you wonâ€™t regret it ;)</p>
