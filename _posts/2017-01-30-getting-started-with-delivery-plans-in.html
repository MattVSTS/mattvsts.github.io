<p>Last week Microsoft released a very interesting extension for VSTS – <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-plans">Delivery Plans</a>.</p> <p>It is still a very early preview, it will be associated with a business model (so it is likely it won’t be free), and this feature represents a very important expansion of VSTS’ field of execution. </p> <p>This extension brings a way of tracking the work undertaken by multiple teams at the same time, with the possibility of focusing only on a <strong>certain level of detail</strong>, and enables scenarios of delivery forecast previously quite hard to achieve.</p> <p>To easily get started, I suggest installing the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.SampleDataWidget">Sample Data Widget</a> extension and deploy the “SAFe with VSTS” package. I went for this package because it creates a nice set of Work Items, not because there is any relationship between Delivery Plans and SAFe.</p> <p>Once this is done, customise the iteration dates and the teams you like – I would go with two sub-teams part of a large team - then assign what you feel is better suited to each team (pretty randomly I reckon given we are just using sample data <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CMHkkKAK1Mw/WI8Xu3V894I/AAAAAAAAEUw/Gl5ub0gqobw/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800">) and create a Plan like this:</p> <p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sxJgyaL33gY/WI8Xvg3Zs5I/AAAAAAAAEU4/wrF8xe9WeBQ/s1600-h/image%25255B3%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AttMp0VJ1Ic/WI8XwqO3f0I/AAAAAAAAEVA/ucAiSMbXjOk/image_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="504" height="116"></a></p> <p>This is a plan designed to give you a full breadth of information, from the larger parts to the finer details. The result is brilliant:</p> <p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MQhizUN4RxE/WI8XxZSrFiI/AAAAAAAAEVI/gjrpRp4A09M/s1600-h/image%25255B11%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-r1p664eG_9g/WI8XyYPpPWI/AAAAAAAAEVQ/IjMJIrXfHsU/image_thumb%25255B5%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="504" height="1066"></a></p> <p>In a single page you will get a timeline view of Epics and Features delivered per-sprint by the whole team, plus the User Stories delivered by each sub-team. This is obviously overkill for the real world – you will want two different plans depending on the level of detail you would like to provide – but it explains why this feature is so powerful and game-changing for me.</p>  <p>Delivery Plans will enable scenarios where stakeholders can easily understand the status of their value streams without using external reporting tools, and this is a crucial step to allow VSTS to grow from a developement-focused tool to a more general purpose in a company.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/work/scale/review-team-plans">documentation</a> is already very comprehensive, take a look there and I strongly suggest to give a go to this extension, given the value it brings.</p>
