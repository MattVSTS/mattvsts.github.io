<p>Having to deal with Git when you come from years of another Version Control System can be hard – I was very comfortable with the Team Foundation Version Control and in the rare cases I needed a distributed VCS my choice went to Mercurial.  <p>I was very biased against Git, for several reasons. But then, after using it and dealing with it at work, I managed to find a position for it in my toolbox. Let’s see the reasons which made me <i>accepting </i>Git <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Smile" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-HzeN-jPSRSU/U1utPec9eNI/AAAAAAAABVg/blu61IipGNs/wlEmoticon-smile2.png?imgmax=800"></p> <h2>Git is different</h2> <p>Yes, indeed. It was born with a specific purpose (VCS for the Linux kernel) and with a specific target in mind – kernel developers. Git is sometimes counterintuitive and not consistent, you have to learn it from the ground up <strong>without comparing it </strong>with other VCSs. <br>Despite it is a VCS, you can <strong>change the history</strong> of your source tree for example. You just have to understand that it is different, that’s all.</p> <h2>It is a great tool to be used with Team Foundation Server</h2> <p>Team Foundation Server is maybe one of the most interoperable product at Microsoft, and including Git inside it has been a marvellous choice. <br>You can have <strong>heterogeneous projects</strong> thanks to it, and even use it together with the TFVC if you want – with <strong>git-tf</strong>. And do not forget the migration capability – there are countless tools for migrating from other VCSs to Git.</p> <h2>It is lightweight and fast</h2> <p>Despite its steep learning curve, once you are familiar with the basic commands Git is blazingly fast and lightweight – thanks to its distributed nature.</p> <p>These are the main reasons which led me to live with Git without fighting with it. I am still a learner on the subject though, maybe in the future there might be a revised version of the list. Let’s see <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Smile" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-HzeN-jPSRSU/U1utPec9eNI/AAAAAAAABVg/blu61IipGNs/wlEmoticon-smile2.png?imgmax=800"></p>
