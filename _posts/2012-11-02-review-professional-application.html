It’s detailed but introductive, perfect for the target audience.</p> <p>After that, it describes how to gather feedbacks from stakeholders, and how to let them participate in the requirements management phase.</p> <p>The Project Management section is comprehensive, rounding from Work Items to Dashboards, describing all the tools involved in a complete ALM process. It’s not just about the tools and how to use them, several pages are dedicated to process and methodologies, making it a manual in the manual for Project Management with Team Foundation Server.</p> <p>After these first three parts, the following are more code-focused: Architecture, Software Development and Testing. They fully cover the new features but always with the process companion. Really useful for both novice and experienced people who might want to have a reference.</p> <p>Despite it has the same title of the 2010 version, several parts have been redone both after feedbacks and to have a different approach. I really liked this book, it’s a must-have for everyone.</p>
