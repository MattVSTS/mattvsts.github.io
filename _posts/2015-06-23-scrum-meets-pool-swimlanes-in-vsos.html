<p>With the update of <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/2015-jun-3-vso.aspx">June 3rd</a> VSO got a new and very useful feature in the Backlog Board: swimlanes.</p> <p>What does that mean? It means you can have this situation:</p> <p><a href="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RPtgGCQDU-4/VYltQv8A0tI/AAAAAAAACBU/kk4FYofytrE/s1600-h/image%25255B3%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xpnaA00gPew/VYltRwHlVfI/AAAAAAAACBg/uIf9iJVQwDk/image_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="584" height="405"></a> </p> <p>This allows for an even finer time and resources management, for example. It mostly impacts prioritisation, something that happens with critical bugs stopping a production system. Keep in mind that a swimlane configured as above should be used very sparingly.</p> <p>It could be even more creative:</p> <p><a href="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RDAOfkjz-bQ/VYltTBQ_IZI/AAAAAAAACBs/-PUyVDF8xZ4/s1600-h/image%25255B9%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-j-2eMHHhON4/VYltUjQXYUI/AAAAAAAACB4/FR2cmz3iE74/image_thumb%25255B5%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="584" height="434"></a> </p> <p>You might be selling a product which, from time to time, has customer’s personalisations, which you need to schedule with the product itself. This is another way of using the swimlanes.</p> <p>It is a tool which increases the flexibility a lot – but remember that it is just an aid, it doesn’t work <em>as a given</em>. Your process must be already resilient to this, and the tools is only there to help.</p>
