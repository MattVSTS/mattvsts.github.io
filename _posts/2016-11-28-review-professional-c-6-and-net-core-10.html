<p>.NET Core brings so many changes, even if you don’t write production code on a daily basis you might want to have a refresh <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4ZvhmBtSN9g/WDxZSPEdG7I/AAAAAAAAEJs/adFOmEl8X1k/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800"> and that’s what I did with <a href="http://twitter.com/christiannagel">Christian Nagel’s</a> book.</p> <p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W2zXLS6etvI/WDxZTDs8-YI/AAAAAAAAEJ0/qzu9dNpF_A0/s1600-h/DSC_0024%25255B3%25255D.jpg"><img title="DSC_0024" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="DSC_0024" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DZjZ7Pe1jpE/WDxZUNCnUlI/AAAAAAAAEJ8/IGfEYOGL6GA/DSC_0024_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" width="184" height="244"></a></p> <p>It is very well flowing and never too near a knowledge base article – Christian writes very well. The content in there is for Visual Studio 2015, but you can definitely use it with 2017 as well.</p> <p>I was particularly interested in the .NET Core and ASP.NET Core sections, and I reckon they are really a fresh and clear starting point on the matter. Given we are talking about a printed book it might not be fully updated, but again it is a matter of a few touches here and there. It is worth remembering that it is stuff in continuous evolution, so I would expect it.</p> <p>But the book definitely isn’t just about .NET Core and ASP.NET Core. It covers extremely well the stack from top to bottom, and I quite enjoyed the <em>What’s new in C# 6.0<strong> </strong></em>section<em> </em>and the <em>recap</em> from C# 1.0 to 6.0 in the first pages. As I said it is about the whole stack, so once you are off the first 450 pages (Part I is all about the language) you can tackle the IDE, the Compiler Platform and more.</p> <p>I particularly liked how broad the approach was. The <strong>Testing section </strong>for example mentions not only MSTest but also xUnit, and in both .NET Core and .NET Framework, the <strong>Diagnostics section </strong>mentions Application Insights, etc. Christian did an amazing job summarising these broad but also specialist topics, and the result is really well-integrated</p> <p>I am a huge fan of books, and I really enjoy having a well-written reference I can dive into instead of going straight to Google, losing context in the meantime. This is one of these, and I also strongly suggest this book to whoever needs a refresh or is tackling C# and the Microsoft stack with a bit of past experience.</p>
