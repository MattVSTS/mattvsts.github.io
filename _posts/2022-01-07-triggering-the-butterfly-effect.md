title: Triggering the butterfly effect
tags: [devops]

An interesting conversation came up a few weeks ago at a conference panel: there is definitely one strong misconception when it comes to Software Engineering, DevOps and transformations in general - if you want to _start_, you _**need**_ a number of things which might seem necessary. 

That's why I strongly disagree. The reality is that these _things_ might actually be overkill, useless or even damaging to your business. In order to _start_, you need a catalyst. And for the catalyst to be effective, you need to bring tangible value straight-away.

Think about it, for any of the topics above: what do you need to get going? Anyone you ask will give you a different answer, and it usually relies on a technology, a certain flavour of a methodology or even worse a tool. Some will even throw in _culture_, for good measure. However I disagree. It's not _just_ that. These are all _consequences_.

Keep things simple. You want to start with DevOps? Don't think about a tool, or any other substantial change that will bring you to a standstill. The business needs to keep going! Instead, start by introducing **automation**. 

Automate something, and incrementally go from there. Scripting does wonders. Once the automation is in place it will reduce the amount of time a certain operation takes (compared to a manual interaction) and will also reduce the risk of errors. CI/CD is an excellent starting point, but it isn't necessarily the only one. If you already have CI/CD in place but you want to go further, look into automating configurations, reducing manual maintenance actions, etc.

Long story short, the goal is to enable you and your team to re-invest that time you are saving into further automations and other (potentially bigger) changes. This is the butterfly effect of DevOps.
