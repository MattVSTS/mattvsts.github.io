<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I thought about reviewing The DevOps Handbook, but then I realised its real reference value. Books like this, with multiple layers of usage are really invaluable.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1t4P3Dyn-TY/WS7e-KsqtdI/AAAAAAAAEdg/VCuvyjZPDMsY3knyPtZL3fsUULjD6Hr5ACLcB/s1600/DSC_0052.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1200" height="400" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1t4P3Dyn-TY/WS7e-KsqtdI/AAAAAAAAEdg/VCuvyjZPDMsY3knyPtZL3fsUULjD6Hr5ACLcB/s400/DSC_0052.JPG" width="300" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This book is gold IMHO, and not just for its cover colour. But let’s rewind a bit.<br /><br />I bought the book in January, I read the first few chapters then I forgot it at my parents’. Fast forward a few months, my brother comes visiting and he brings the book back, but it is then then left on the <em>to read</em> pile for a while.<br /><br />Eventually I managed to find time to read it and here I am writing this post.<br />So why isn’t this a regular review? <em>What</em> did I realise, all of a sudden?<br /><br />Well, books can be easily read in a few days, a couple of weeks tops. What happened is that each chapter I read was providing insights or mirrored situations I experienced during these months.<br /><br />Each chapter can be cherry-picked and adapted to your situation, because it starts from a real scenario with real requirements and targets. You will notice patterns going through the book, all the concepts are there but applied in a tailored way to fit the problems one has to face.<br /><br />I can see this book being a useful guide you might want to refer to when you are tackling a problem, just pick the chapter more akin to the approach you are using and you will feel guided. </div>
