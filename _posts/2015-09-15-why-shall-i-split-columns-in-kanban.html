<p>A very interesting discussion came out at the SmartDevsUG meeting last night about the Kanban Split Columns in TFS and VSO. What is the real rationale behind it in a real world project? Why should I have a <strong>Resolved </strong>column split in <strong>Doing </strong>and <strong>Done</strong>, for example?</p> <p><a href="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7qdp6geBZVQ/VffxfMTbOgI/AAAAAAAACWs/Vxwim1quIm4/s1600-h/image%25255B2%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-s0RUdmzWIa8/Vffxf2caxkI/AAAAAAAACW4/5BAlteMMKUI/image_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="244" height="96"></a> </p> <p>Without taking into consideration the Kanban principles behind this tool, I have an easier explanation. If you step back from the technical stuff for a moment and you think about the <strong>business side</strong> of it, it is pretty clear.</p> <p>For example, you are working on a customer hotfix for your product – the code is done, the fix is tested thoroughly and you are <em>technically</em> done. But you aren’t completely done – did you deliver the hotfix to the customer? Or from a different perspective, is it billed? Until this hurdle isn’t cleared, you are in a <strong>Resolved-Done </strong>situation.</p>
