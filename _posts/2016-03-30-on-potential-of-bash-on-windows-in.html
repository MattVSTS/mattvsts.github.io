<p>One of the announcements of todays’ //build is the availability of Bash on Windows, thanks to Ubuntu. I share the excitement as well, but focus on individual developers left something behind IMHO: it is a great step ahead for development purposes on development machines, but also from a DevOps perspective. <p>Let’s put it in this way – if you are developing a cross-platform application, which can run on both Windows and Linux, you now have the potential of a single set of scripts for automation. <p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eRrm2VK7Aug/Vvw1fYa08-I/AAAAAAAAC8E/GUnlOVvoqeI/s1600-h/image%25255B2%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RKwl5M80TAM/Vvw1giW2M2I/AAAAAAAAC8M/yRsOHwKjUQQ/image_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="244" height="49"></a> <p>You won’t have to maintain two different sets of scripts. You will be targeting both Windows and non-Windows machines, with the same logic, reducing maintenance costs by roughly half and standardising on procedures which would work on both. <p>I really see it as a game changer in the DevOps world! <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Smile" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bd1YZfe10ew/Vvw1h4M1YaI/AAAAAAAAC8U/aNjeEGPge4s/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800">
