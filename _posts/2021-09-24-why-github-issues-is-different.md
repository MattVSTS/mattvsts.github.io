title: Why GitHub Issues is different
tags: [github]

The point of this post is not to do a walkthrough of the new [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues/) experience (it's awesome by the way!), but rather to think about what I believe is the reason and the ethos of the feature. It was inspired by a conversation with colleagues which I believe was worth sharing.

As developers, we got used to the _sticky note experience_ - the requirements you are aware of are summarised with a sticky note, with a title, and no other information is brought to the forefront of what you see as the first impact. Hence the Azure Boards experience, in a nutshell, where the complexity of the requirement sits a level below view.

The reason why I like Azure Boards so much is that you are _just_ one level away from all the details, compared with other tools. However, I like it because I am used to go back and forth between backlogs, teams and projects. This experience acts as a common denominator across projects and organisations, with an agreement saying that if I need more information about an item I can click on it and get it all.

Brilliant, but not really practical from an **individual** perspective. Why? Because of the context switch between the overall status and the actual progress. If you want to switch from a board to a list (the backlog?) you literally need to move from a place to the other. Context switch is expensive in both computer programming and human behaviour.

GitHub Issues doesn't do that - you can customise a tabular view with all the key information:

And by clicking on the arrow you can immediately switch to a board view:

which will contain the same information in a different visualisation, without forcing you to context switch between the two:

Now, there is no _better_ way. GitHub Issues gives you something different, which you can customise and integrate with other tools. Some people might like it in a way, some others might prefer another one.
