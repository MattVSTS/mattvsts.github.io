<p><strong>TL;DR version – yes.</strong></p> <p>Many think that Scrum (and Agile in general) and CMMI cannot live together. After some years researching about that, my opinion is that this assumption is <strong>false</strong>.</p> <p>Let’s keep things simple – CMMI is based on a binary process: planning plus execution. We have a (sometimes very) high level planning, each hierarchy level with its requirements and so on.</p> <p>Can the execution phase keep on with that? <strong>It can</strong> – breaking down large features into smaller PBIs and then tasks is <strong>not something exclusive</strong> to Scrum but it can be applied to CMMI as well, <strong>with great results</strong>.</p> <p>The Definition of Done as well <strong>can be integrated</strong> as a part of the CMMI Requirements and criteria, this is another simple yet effective example.</p> <p>The CMMI Institute has a very interesting article <a href="http://cmmiinstitute.com/cmmi-getting-started/cmmi-compatibility/cmmi-and-agile/cmmi-and-scrum/">digest</a> on the topic – I really like this quote from the above:</p> <blockquote> <p>As an Agile method, Scrum promotes frequent inspection and adaptation, teamwork, self-organization, and accountability. CMMI focuses on improving processes to improve performance.</p></blockquote> <p>And what about TFS? Well…all the tools are standard regardless of the Process Template, so the answer is obvious again.</p>
