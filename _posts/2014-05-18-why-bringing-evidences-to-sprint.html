<p>The most common question in all the situations of an average software development project is not “<em>How?</em>” but instead “<em>Why?</em>” – and in particular:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Why did we do/act/decide that way?”</em></p></blockquote> <p>With the wealth of technologies available today it is not a matter of <strong>how </strong>anymore, because a new framework, a new tool comes up every week so we do not face the same technology challenges as twenty years ago – today is all about the <strong>why</strong>, because we can tackle the same problem in many different ways but each solution is going to have something special.</p> <p>This is why I bringing evidences – when needed and possible, of course – to a Sprint Retrospective meeting becomes real value for the team.</p> <blockquote> <p>“<em>During this sprint we did this <strong>because</strong> we found out that: …</em>”</p></blockquote> <p>Making this an habit improves the quality on the long term: if you enter this information throughout the development, ideally at each Sprint Retrospective, into a wiki it creates an informal and backed <strong>knowledge base</strong> which will surely be reusable in the future.</p> <p>There is a high value behind this task: you are <strong>tracking all the decisions </strong>made during the project. It is also a basic form of Evidence-based Management if you wish, with all its pros.</p>
