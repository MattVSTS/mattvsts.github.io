<p>This is very quick but helpful IMHO.</p> <p>Scenario: you are an external consultant and you need to run a job from the Team Foundation Server web services (<strong>ProcessWarehouse</strong>, just to mention one of them), but you cannot access the server itself because of some security policy.</p> <p>You ask someone in the IT department to run it on behalf of you, but of course you want to check how long does it take. <strong>How?</strong></p> <p>By using the <strong>TFS Operational Intelligence</strong>. If you check the <strong>Job Queue</strong> list, you will get all the running and scheduled jobs for the server.</p> <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-o6-PWErODr4/U00Xal8Xn-I/AAAAAAAABVI/7W0pWlzAVec/s1600-h/image%25255B3%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-b95HQyXtjrg/U00Xb6MvYNI/AAAAAAAABVQ/QDpZ2_UujBE/image_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="400" height="166"></a> </p> <p>If a job is running you will get the actual running time, otherwise the last execution’s time.</p>
