<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">The last Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results shows that <em><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/insights/survey/2017#work-how-are-job-satisfaction-and-committing-code-related">the  more a developer ships the happier (s)he is.</a>&nbsp;</em><br />Of course we see a huge  amount of people checking in multiple times a day, but also a large amount of  people checking in (so potentially building and deploying) much less than  that.<br /><br />So, looking at the other side of the medal: <i>why </i>aren’t you shipping  often?<br /><br />Reasons – as usual – are varied. There might be process constraints  (certifications, etc.), hard requirements, but I’ve often seen a heavy reliance  on older deployment procedures which are considered too expensive to be  replaced by automation. Don’t touch what works, right?<br /><br />Web applications are a stellar example of this. You might have the most  complex web app in the world, but why should you manually move stuff around when  you can pack everything in a MSDeploy package?<br /><br />“<em>But that is for Azure and cloud technology and stuff!</em>”<br /><br />Wrong answer!&nbsp;MSDeploy is around since <a href="https://blogs.iis.net/msdeploy/web-deployment-tool-1-0-has-shipped">2009</a>  and it is well supported on-premise as well! So why aren’t you using it for your  existing application? It is, after all, the same concept Tomcat uses for its  .war files.<br /><br />      <br />This isn’t about throwing years of valuable content in the sink. It is often  a matter of trying to split the larger problem into smaller components, and  approaching different delivery vehicles. You can retain your existing application <b>as-is</b>, just replacing how you bring it into your production environments.</div>
