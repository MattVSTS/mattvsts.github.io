I can already hear the voices…”why are you reviewing a three years old book?” “It is on 2010, it is outdated!” and so on.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://5piexa.bay.livefilestore.com/y2pmAJ_3Jx1SUMJEv1QMFEZrfXYHL9POCzuSJEC-rGtoDfdRNTuySTM4tzvmktXXwdbNnXYEum_9zTYb8n7lacw-e4Aj_upnXK6tGtYxzbJpWI/WP_20130912_001.jpg?psid=1" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://5piexa.bay.livefilestore.com/y2pmAJ_3Jx1SUMJEv1QMFEZrfXYHL9POCzuSJEC-rGtoDfdRNTuySTM4tzvmktXXwdbNnXYEum_9zTYb8n7lacw-e4Aj_upnXK6tGtYxzbJpWI/WP_20130912_001.jpg?psid=1" width="225" /></a></div><br />Instead – trust me – I would strongly suggest you to buy it, for a simple reason. All the features used and explained in this book are the same or very similar from 2010 on, as we are talking about essential, cornerstone features.<br />Moreover, the book covers the very needed concepts needed for Scrum, so it is very helpful when you have to introduce a team to it.<br />The authors (<strong>Steve Resnick </strong>– Architect at Courion Corporation, <strong>Michael de la Maza</strong> – Agile Coach and Investor, <strong>Aaron Bjork</strong> – Senior Program Manager at Microsoft) explain everything with a very good pace and the required level of detail: they go step-by-step in every required part of the Scrum methodology, and at the end you will find a dedicated chapter on <strong>Spikes </strong>and an appendix dedicated to the Scrum Assessment.<br />It is very handy to use as a quick reference, just grab the required chapter and you would get your answer. <br />I am going to use it with a new team to be inducted to Scrum, by keeping it on the table during the daily Scrum and every Meeting. I bet it is going to be helpful <img alt="Smile" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-9Ehqy3NfevA/UjthDsmh0wI/AAAAAAAABLs/EZVMizqiuXU/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" />
