<p>This is a classic question I get at least once a year, regardless of TFS, VSTS, versions, etc.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>I cannot see my Product Backlog Item on the board anymore! Is it gone? Are we losing data?</em></p></blockquote> <p>No, we are not losing data, but you need to remember that if you are linking a PBI/User Story as a child to another one the parent won’t be shown in the board, and that is by design.</p> <p>This is something that dates back a few year – Willy <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/willy-peter_schaub/2013/09/27/the-hunt-for-stealth-tasks-what-happened-to-my-task-on-the-tfs-task-board/">covered</a> it in 2013 but it is an older discussion theme, always worth remembering it though <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ILkDRCvY9EE/WIYBXey9FNI/AAAAAAAAEUQ/BdB2uura_O4/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800"></p>
