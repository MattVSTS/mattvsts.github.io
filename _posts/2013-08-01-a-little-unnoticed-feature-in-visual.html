It is not something you go around shouting “This is a life changer!”, but IMHO it has its own dignity and it is going to gain more and more importance in the future releases. <br />I am talking about the Visual Studio Notifications Center. It is something which is based on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2013/06/26/a-few-more-visual-studio-2013-preview-features.aspx">Connected IDE</a>, maybe the first example of its integration into Visual Studio, together with the Roaming Settings.<br />It is a small icon on top of the IDE…<br /><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-C2XHiEFcmb4/Ue-v8kstUOI/AAAAAAAABEo/dN7ASX1yEAI/s1600-h/image%25255B2%25255D.png"><img alt="image" border="0" height="45" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-jbj5uzNZsRA/Ue-v9JubaKI/AAAAAAAABEw/KtkVjC8HRnc/image_thumb.png?imgmax=800" style="border-width: 0px; display: inline;" title="image" width="68" /></a> <br />…which opens a Notification pane:<br /><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-K2fUMJXS9Uo/Ue-v9qMoxUI/AAAAAAAABE4/MjUJWjgugwI/s1600-h/image%25255B5%25255D.png"><img alt="image" border="0" height="230" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-sSZGhz27bVI/Ue-v9wtiMLI/AAAAAAAABFA/60fdWm697bg/image_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800" style="border-width: 0px; display: inline;" title="image" width="244" /></a> <br />IMHO it is important because it could be the notifications’ hub for informative content (help installation, license expiration) but updates as well.
