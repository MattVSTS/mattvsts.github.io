Despite it is tightly integrated with Team Foundation Server, InRelease is – as far as today –&nbsp; a standalone product.<br />It is formed of three components: a Server, a Client and as many Deployers you might need, installed on the servers where you are going to deploy you application.<br />Everything is so granular, it reminds of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll">Russian nested doll</a>.<br />You are going to create a <strong>Release</strong>. The Release is based on a <strong>Template</strong> which defines the stages and the actions of a deployment. <br /><br /><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-QalZK7IRL2o/UevHy1_q_WI/AAAAAAAABD4/unA5qLQy2Ns/s1600-h/image%25255B3%25255D.png"><img alt="image" border="0" height="227" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-QT8pzm4VcWg/UevHzWM9mFI/AAAAAAAABD8/95HUG56iiJw/image_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-width: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="image" width="384" /></a><br /><br />It is based on Windows Workflow Foundation, and it is very intuitive. You can find a huge amount of out-of-the-box actions and the InRelease <strong>Components</strong>, we are going to see in a separate post what are they and how to customize them.<br /><br />In order to be able to deploy, the Template must feature <strong>Environments</strong>, containers for the target <strong>Servers</strong> running the Deployer component.<br />In my case, I created two Environments (Development and Production), each containing one server (dev.domain.tld and prod.domain.tld).<br />As you can see in the picture, for this sample the deployment pipeline is extremely easy: create a folder in the target server and copy some files into it.<br />Then the simplest release workflow is based on approvals: you must approve the deployment and the successful completion. It is possible to make approvals and rejection from both the Console or the handy web interface.<br /><br /><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-85t7zVtG7Hs/UevHzl4y3KI/AAAAAAAABEI/53MRICPjUbw/s1600-h/image%25255B7%25255D.png"><img alt="image" border="0" height="111" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-zntLtUlw_5I/UevH0LmmzKI/AAAAAAAABEM/0hYD7YSFslI/image_thumb%25255B3%25255D.png?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-width: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="image" width="440" /></a><br />These are the basic concepts you might need to know about InRelease <img alt="Smile" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-VjtTMjWf9GU/UevH0ZJ6JwI/AAAAAAAABEU/YbzdcyWWcGc/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" />
