I just noticed it today, it might have been around for a while... however if you are an Azure DevOps Administrator you will like this.

The Extensions settings page now shows the approval state of each extension:

If an Extension is considered a **High privilege** one, it will be highlighted, and in the details you can find what is the permission that is flagged as high privilege:

Extensions (and their lifecycle management) are often a time-consuming and critical part of the role of an Azure DevOps Administrator, this is a small yet very welcome quality of life improvement!
