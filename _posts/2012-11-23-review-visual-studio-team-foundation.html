The first section is not just for beginners: there are concepts which even after a years-long seniorship, could be hard to fully understand. Do not underestimate how these concepts might be similar but different: after these the destiny of your project can be strictly dependent.</p> <p>Then we have a chapter for everyone of the four classic pillars of Software Development, using Team Foundation Server: Architecture, Development, Build and Lab, Test. But do not expect anything ‘classic’ here: the content is extremely fit to the topic of the book, and it’s really comprehensive.</p> <p>The last two chapters are not product or methodology focused: one is about the lesson learned at Microsoft – inside the Developer Division – and believe me, every word is worth of notice because it clearly explains what happens in a huge division like DevDiv, and what are issues and stop factors you might find in a real world scenario like that.</p> <p>The other is on how to integrate the Continuous Feedback inside the usual workflow of the team, not technology focused but more on the theoretical side of the problem.</p> <p>The target is pretty clear - Product Owners, Scrum Masters – but, again, not just for beginners: concepts explained here are not just Visual Studio ALM tied or step-by-step tutorials, they are just <em>declined</em> on the product, but agnostic on their side.</p> <p>The book has lots in common with the previous release, it’s normal as it’s on methodologies and practices, but it has been broadly update for Visual Studio 2012 – so don’t expect a mere copy&amp;paste. In the end, it’s a great resource for people working with planning, prioritizations and code quality.</p>
