<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Today is my last day at Quest Software and One Identity. Moving on has been a hard-thought decision, after over five and a half years. I met some great people there, and I managed to grow a lot given the different perspective I found myself in after day one.<br />Working with <a href="https://twitter.com/hussar77?lang=en">Vladimir Gusarov</a> was thoroughly great, we've gone through a lot of scenarios and situations but we always managed to get positives out of them.<br /><br />It is never easy to move on - so many memories and experiences to carry on with you. The company deserves a huge 'thank you!' for this ride, and I can only speak well about them. Thanks!<br /><br />Now, where am I moving to? Well... I could tease you, but it would be kinda pointless ðŸ˜Š I am moving back to Avanade, but in the UK branch.<br /><br />This means I am going to work with a somewhat known group of people - <a href="https://twitter.com/arora_tarun?lang=en">Tarun Arora</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vlatkoivanovski?lang=en">Vlatko Ivanovski</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/onlyutkarsh?lang=en-gb">Utkarsh Shigihalli</a>&nbsp;for starters. But I will also manage to catch up with people I worked with when six years ago... maybe I should start rehearsing my best version of Terminator's "<i>I am back</i>" ðŸ˜‚</div>
