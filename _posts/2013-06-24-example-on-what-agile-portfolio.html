<p>I have been asked about a quick example, so let’s take this screenshot:</p> <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-Ivo83eUcQNs/Ucg3pOp-YqI/AAAAAAAAA-0/qu9_POvR7X8/s1600-h/image%25255B9%25255D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-FaaThNkFBkw/Ucg3qO6T97I/AAAAAAAAA-8/rS88lT-YGoY/image_thumb%25255B5%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="681" height="154"></a> </p> <p>This is something you can achieve today via Project. But it is not feasible in Team Foundation Server 2012 stating that the “As a customer…” are User Stories. You must use the Project Server integration, setting Project Server and the integration up, it is an expensive process and it is not suitable for everybody.</p> <p>Here’s why I feel the Agile Portfolio Management is <strong>very useful</strong>. I understand Project Server is not for everybody, and this new features enable scenarios which were an exclusive of Project Server in the past.</p> <p>Of course Project Server is not going away, but at least now if you have a well defined scenario you can choose which tool to use.</p>
