<p>So, big question: why should I run a pre-release Team Foundation Server update in production? Isn’t it risky? And what about support in case things go wrong?</p> <p>The biggest reason why you’d want to do that is because you really want to allow your users to enjoy the very latest features of the platform. </p> <p>For example now we have TFS 2015 Update 2 available as a <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/news/tfs2015-update2-vs">Release Candidate 1</a>, and you might really want to deploy it because it includes the new Release Management features (for the record, I am <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Smile" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YgiK6IL8ZTU/VtXm9OOWybI/AAAAAAAAC1A/U_HDVXWBulg/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800">). You can also have reasons related to performance problems, very specific bugs, etc. but usually features are the <em>culprit</em>.</p> <p>The quality bar is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/mt656781.aspx">pretty high</a>. I ran many non-RTM releases in production and I hit very few problems or blockers, with live loads and real users’ expectations. </p> <p>The second best thing about running a go-live pre-release is, oddly enough, support in case things go south. If you have a production issue with a pre-release of TFS, you get some kind of special attentions <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Smile" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YgiK6IL8ZTU/VtXm9OOWybI/AAAAAAAAC1A/U_HDVXWBulg/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800"> and for free! </p> <p>That is because you are providing some very useful feedback from production scenarios, collaborating to increase the overall quality even more.</p> <p>And eventually – if you upgrade to a pre-release you are still on the official upgrade path, so you can move off it without problems when the RTM is out.</p> <p>There is a trick though – you must run only <strong>go-live</strong> releases in production. It might sound obvious, but think about it for a second: it is a pre-release, but if it carries the go-live license it means the quality is high enough to be trusted in production. Different story if we look at CTPs or betas – they often aren’t go-live supported and they are meant only as an evaluation version for future upgrades.</p>
