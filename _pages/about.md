Welcome, this is my technical blog. I work in the technology industry, and my focus has always been on Application Lifecycle Management, DevOps and modern Software Engineering practices.
Here you won't find much code on its own, but a rather different approach based on certain features of the tools I know and deal with on a daily basis. 
I am a solution-focused enthusiast, technology on its own just bores me. What really makes me tick is when a good crafted technology solution design meets a well executed business process, providing value at an order of magniture larger than the effort.

Since 2010 Microsoft awarded me a [Most Valuable Professional Award](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4027206?fullName=Matteo Emili) for my contributions to the technology community, an effort I do on my own time and which I really care about. I am also a founder of several technical communities in different countries, where I contribute by running the regular community meetings, organising conferences or facilitating networking, and a regular speaker at European meetups and conferences. I am also a Professional Scrum Master 1 and a Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist.
