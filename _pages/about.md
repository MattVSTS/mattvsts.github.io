Welcome, this is my technical blog. I work in the technology industry, and my focus has always been on Application Lifecycle Management, DevOps and modern Software Engineering practices. 

Here you wonâ€™t find much code on its own, but a rather different approach based on certain features of the tools I know and deal with on a daily basis. I am a solution-focused enthusiast, technology on its own just bores me. What really makes me tick is when a good crafted technology solution design meets a well executed business process, providing value at an order of magniture larger than the effort.

I hold a [Professional Scrum Master 1](https://www.scrum.org/user/168055) certification, but I am more of a pragmatist - processes should bring value, not just the inhevitable disruption dollowed by change. I believe we should always do what makes sense in an organisation.

Since 2010 Microsoft awarded me a [Most Valuable Professional Award](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4027206?fullName=Matteo Emili) for my contributions to the community, an effort I do on my own time and which I really care about. I am also a founder of several technical communities in different countries, where I contribute by running the regular community meetings, organising conferences or facilitating networking, and a regular speaker at European meetups and conferences.
