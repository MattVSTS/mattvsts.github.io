# This is my speaking calendar for 2024
I am always happy to come and speak at your meetup, event or conference.  
You can find my speaker profile [here](https://sessionize.com/matteoemili) with my most recent abstracts, however feel free to get in touch if there is a specific topic you would like to see discussed.  

These are my currently confirmed engagements for 2024!
